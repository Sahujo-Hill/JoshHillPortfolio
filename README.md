This is my portfolio project. I wanted my portfolio to be a project in it's own right as it will likely be the first thing one sees when viewing my work. This best reflects my understanding of design principles such as: Use of space, Attention drawing, Colour manipulation, Minimalism, Intuitive design, Feature exposure and Use of type. This project best demonstrates my CSS and creative understanding (whilst still acting as a portfolio).

### It contains:
- Minimalistc take on what can usually become a cluttered portfolio space
- Accessible navigation, no searching for hidden information
- Projects page with links to my projects as well as a brief description of the project (on wider screens)
- Background page which gives information and my aspirations
- ---

#### Factors I'm happy with:
- Reflects my design in Figma almost 1:1 with a few changes made post build
- Challenged my media query ability
- Layout and organisation
- Expresses myself without unnecessary exposition

#### Pain points:
- Large fonts and bigger text in general lead to media issues later on
- Maybe too simple, although that was the concept
- Some inconsistent CSS due to larger amount and breaks between build

#### What I'd do next:
- Additional pages that link to github or socials etc.
- Continue to improve the CSS and its consistency throughout
- Next time, build from Mobile to Wide Screen to help with media queries
